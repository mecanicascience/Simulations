# Tidal forces
Exact simulation of the tidal forces between the Moon and the Earth.

## Simulation tools

The Euler method to calculate velocity and position was used with the exact formulas and the data from the real situation. The code was written with [PSEngine](https://github.com/mecanicascience/PhysicsSimulationEngine) 3.1.0.

## Use

The simulation will look something like this:
