# Simulations
Repository containing all the simulations published on [MecanicaScience](https://www.mecanicascience.fr/simulations/list/).

## Simulation tools

The exact method used depends on the simulation: in general, it is Euler with the exact formulas from the problem, if there are forces involved. Code is written with [PSEngine](https://github.com/mecanicascience/PhysicsSimulationEngine).

## Use

The simulations will look something like this:

All you have to do is play around with the value sliders and checkboxes in the upper-right corner.
