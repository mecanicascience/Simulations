# Simulations
This repository contains all of the simulations published on the [MecanicaScience](https://www.mecanicascience.fr/simulations/list/) website. The Mecanicascience website aim to explain some physics concepts of the everyday world, to describe them through mathematics equations of several difficulty levels, then to construct some visualisations to better understand theses abstract ideas. 
All of them are free to use as long as you cite the original author.
